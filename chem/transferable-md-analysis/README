Analysis tools written using the python MDAnalysis library.
As such, the tools accept a multitude of file formats and should work
with Gromacs/Amber/OpenMM simulation output with no issues.

For LAMMPS simulations, ensure the trajectory is written in the 'atom' style (dump ... atom).
This is the only LAMMPS trajectory format accepted by MDAnalysis. Alternatively, write trajectories
to a DCD format (dump ... dcd), which are handled completely.
and then edit the Universe constructor in each of the scripts if necessary.
